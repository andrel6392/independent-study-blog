# Full Circle

## Product

The project me and my group had worked on was basically a place where you can search for books and have the option to save your books using a database. The difference from this project and using Ruby Sinatra is that everything was done in some form of Javascript and Firebase. After authentication process,i.e logging into your gMail, you can save books to your specific account. Logging in to your account from any device will show you your saved books and nobody elses. You can either click [Booklastic](https://blank-bbe14.firebaseapp.com/) or manually type in the shortened link tiny.cc/booklastic

## The Journey and Future Goals

It was a long nine weeks of learning with many bugs. Each one being overcome one at a time, slowly. However, I have come to learn that bugs are great because they are each learning experiences for the next time. Bugs teach you how things should be done and really help increase problem solving skills. I have learned to enjoy bugs throughout this experience and look forware to them because being able to solve them and brings me joy and makes me really feel like I am learning rather than following a tutorial or copying syntax that I previously seen. I also wish to further my knowledge in just pure Javascript because just like when I learned Ruby, I have learned to love it. 

## Takeaways

Blog Entries really aren't my thing. However, I've learned that even though I do not like it, I may be able to help somebody who has had the same error as me. When I would come across bugs and turned to google for help, I either found a Stack Overflow solution, or somebody had written a blog about his journey through solving the bug. I found these to be pretty useful to me and wish to do the same for others. Therefore my goal in future projects is to keep up with my blog posts and hopefully be of use to others after me.
