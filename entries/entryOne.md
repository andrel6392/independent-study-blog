# Independent Study: Firebase Intro

## What is Firebase?

Before getting into the code for  Firebase, I wanted to understand how it works. Essentially it is a realtime database. From my understanding, most databases need to make HTTP requests (searches for data from a web server) in order to get and sync your data. Firebase instead is connected through a WebSocket which is a lot faster than making HTTP requests. A WebSocket automatically sends data to the user as fast as the user's network can carry it. The thing about Firebase that makes it special is that it automatically sends new data as soon as it is updated. For example, if one user saves or changes data, all the users receive the new updated information almost instantly.

## Google and Firebase

Since Firebase is backed by Google, most of Google's services are avaible to be used with Firebase. For example, all the data and files are saved directly to the Google Cloud Storage. However, there are rules and restrictions to prevent your gCloud from the masses of users except from authenticated users that you can decide upon. Another example of Google's services is that you can use their authentication(OAuth2) from gMail, Facebook, Twitter, and even GitHub.

## Why Firebase?

From earlier projects I remember Mr. Mueller, my teacher, telling me about perhaps taking up Firebase when the Independent Study unit comes around. At first I was on the fence about fully committing to this but then Mr. Mueller showed me a simple realtime chatting system that he had created with Firebase. After seeing this I began to have ideas of what I could create and whether or not I could connect Firebase with some of the things I had learned in my previous years of learning code.

## My Plan

###### Week One
This week I had decided to study up on Javascript by completing Codecademy's online course. One thing that I had noticed is how similar Ruby and Javascript are so it wasn't too hard. After reviewing Javascript I looked at the Firebase Documentation and began prepping my workspace.

###### Week Two
The next upcoming week, I plan to be able to tackle on the authentication system in order to be able to make the web chat app. The challenging part about this will most likely be the authentication. Right now, just by looking at the documentation, I can't much sense of it. However, this does not mean that I won't be able to understand it by the end of the week.

###### Remaining Weeks
My plan for this far ahead in the Study is still to be determined. I'm not sure where the authentication will take me and whether or not I will have different ideas on what I want to learn next about Firebase.
